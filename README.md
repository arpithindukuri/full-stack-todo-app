# About

This is a full-stack todo application built entirely by me, Arpith Indukuri.

This purpose of this project is to give me demonstrable experience using industry standard softwares
like SQL, Microsoft Azure, .NET, React.

This project is not meant to be a groundbreaking idea, or have excellent design.
It is meant to demonstrate my ability to implement your idea in a pragmatic and functional manner.
Therefore, the design will be simple, and app functionality will be minimal.
However, I do aim to write excellent code, and deploy a fully functioning, secure, and scalable product.

This project demonstrate my level of competency in:

#### Technical abilities

- Website development (landing page)
- Front-end application development (web and mobile)
- Back-end API development
- Testing
- CI/CD
- Deployment

#### Non-Technical Abilities

- UI/UX design
- Project management
- Codebase management
