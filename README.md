# About

This is a full-stack todo application built entirely by me, Arpith Indukuri.

This purpose of this project is to give me demonstrable experience using industry standard softwares like SQL, Microsoft Azure, .NET, React.

This todo app is not meant to be a groundbreaking idea, or have excellent design.
It is meant to demonstrate my ability to implement your idea in a pragmatic and functional manner, and to manage my projects and tasks.
Therefore, the design will be simple, and app functionality will be minimal.
However, I do aim to write excellent code, and deploy a fully functioning, secure, and scalable product.

This project demonstrate my level of competency in:

#### Technical abilities

- Website development (landing page)
- Front-end application development (web and mobile)
- Back-end API development
- Testing
- CI/CD
- Deployment

#### Non-Technical Abilities

- UI/UX design
- Project management
- Codebase management

# Progress Updates

## Tuesday, April 5th, 2022

I completed the requirements, but took an extra day to flesh it out by researching software requirements online, and format it as a markdown file instead.

I looked into some design ideas for the moodboard, but instead decided to keep it easy and simple and just use the [Material 3 Design Kit by Tharadol Phuhadsaun](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1090781564385530310), found on figma.

Tomorrow, I will hopefully complete a tentative implementation plan, including the technologies to use, my reasoning behind each choice, and a high level architecture diagram.

## Monday, Arpil 4th, 2022

Today, I will complete the requirements doc, and hopefully add some ideas to the moodboard.
